# Website for a bakery and confectionery organization
It is a functioning client-server web application implemented with the Model-View-Controller architecture using Ajax technology and modular concepts. The multi-page website is united by a common theme and a self-designed layout. The functionality is quite extensive: the bakery's clients can view all the information about the establishment, the menu, learn about the features of the products, add items to their cart, and place orders. A unique feature is the ability to customize certain products according to personal preferences using a constructor. Additionally, the client can view all personal data and order information in their personal account. As for the administrator, their capabilities include CRUD operations related to orders, clients, promotional codes, and menu items. In this project, I developed both the frontend and the backend parts.

When it comes to the technologies and tools used for creating the client-side, they naturally included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used the Sass preprocessor to streamline working with stylesheets. For organizing all the SCSS files, I chose the 7-1 directory system. Selector naming followed the BEM methodology. For implementing the server-side, I also used JavaScript, the Node.js server with Express framework, MySQL database and Sequelize library for implementing ORM, JWT tokens for authentication and other tools.
